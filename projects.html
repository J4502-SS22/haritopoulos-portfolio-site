  <h2>Marketing</h2>

        <h3>Mock Campaign: Death Wish Coffee Company</h3>
	<p>Featured below is a series of campaign items produced by my team and myself as a part of an 8-week course dedicated to introduce strategic writing and design concepts. Our proposed client was Death Wish Coffee Co., based out of Saratoga, N.Y.</p>

		<h3>Souvenir Program: Missouri State Fair</h3>
	<p> This is one of the primary projects worked on in the Missouri State Fair Marketing Department during Summer 2021: a souvenir program displaying several pages of details anyone would want to know about what to do at the Fair. </p>
	<br>
<img class="souvenir-program" src="assets/images/souvenir-program.png" alt="PDF cover of the 2021 Missouri State Fair souvenir program with the year's logo, dates, and background image">
<br>
	<p> Out of the total 48 pages, I worked on material on 29 of the pages — with the exception of the front cover and daily schedules crafted by our ad agency. All pages featuring advertisements were inputted by the souvenir program printer, <em>The Sedalia Democrat</em>.</p>
