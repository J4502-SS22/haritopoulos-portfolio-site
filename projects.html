		<h3>Souvenir Program: Missouri State Fair</h3>
	<p> This is one of the primary projects worked on in the Missouri State Fair Marketing Department during Summer 2021: a souvenir program displaying several pages of details anyone would want to know about what to do at the Fair. </p>
	<br>
<img class="souvenir-program" src="assets/images/souvenir-program.png" alt="PDF cover of the 2021 Missouri State Fair souvenir program with the year's logo, dates, and background image">
<br>
	<p> Out of the total 48 pages, I worked on material on 29 of the pages — with the exception of the front cover and daily schedules crafted by our ad agency. All pages featuring advertisements were inputted by the souvenir program printer, <em>The Sedalia Democrat</em>.</p>

<h2>Graphic Design</h2>

<h3>Print</h3>
<h4>Newspaper Layout</h4>
<p>During my high school tenure, I was one of the primary designers for our newspaper, taking on the responsibility of designing the front and back covers as well as an additional news paage during my junior and senior years.
<br>
Here is the final page spread that I designed for the paper during our senior issue in May 2019.</p>
<br>
<img class="news-layout" src="assets/images/news-layout.png" alt="Photo shows a page in the April 2019 Peace Pipe Chatter Newspaper with various photos and headlines reading, 'Thank you, MCHS. Love, Santa,' 'Senior athletes signing for college sports' and an infographic with statistics reading 'What lies ahead for high school grads?'">
	<br>
<h3>Digital</h3>
<h4>Instagram Story Ad</h4>
<p> I have also worked on various social media displays for advertisements and organizations of which I am a member. Featured below is a sample Instagram story ad for the Missouri School of Journalism featuring a photo I took and a quote by the first dean of the school, Walter Williams.</p>
<br>
<img class="instagram-story-ad" src="assets/images/instagram-story-ad.png" alt="Photo shows a graphic with a bridge in the middle and trees on either side. A header across the top reads ‘Missouri School of Journalism,’ ‘University of Missouri’ and ‘The World’s Journalism School,’ with a quote by Walter Williams along the bottom reading ‘Wise shall be the bearers of light.’">
<br>
<h3>Other</h3>
<h4>Infographic: Airlines React to COVID-19</h4>
<p>In an introductory Audiences and Persuasion class, I was assigned a group to develop a persuasive campaign attempting to get people back to air travel in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Displayed is the infographic I designed for airlines to demonstrate the measures they were taking to prevent the spread as people return to travel</p>
<br>
<img class="infographic" src="assets/images/covid-19-infographic.png" alt="Graphic displaying information regarding sanitizing and safety measures taken by airlines as a result of the pandemic. Measures include touchless boarding and tagging, increased cleaning measures, decreased flight capacities and a masked-up guarantee.">

<h2>Multimedia Story Sample: Guardian Oaks Farm</h2>
<p>This is a story package completed by me and three classmates during a semester where were responsible for reporting on the town of Moberly, Missouri. We rotated primary roles for newsgathering practices such as print, audio and photography.
<br> <br>
This piece tells the story of a non-profit organization taking in neglected animals headed for slaughter.
<br> <br>
<em>We used a combination of print, audio and photo elements to tell this story for different media outlets.</em></p>
